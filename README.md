# templating-engine

This should take a map of variables ("day" => "Thursday", "name" => "Billy") as well as a string template ("${name} has an appointment on ${day}") and perform substitution as needed.

This needs to be somewhat robust, throwing some kind of error if a template uses a variable that has not been assigned, as well as provide a way to escape the strings ("hello ${${name}}" -> "hello ${Billy}")
